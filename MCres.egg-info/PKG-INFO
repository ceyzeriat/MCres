        Documentation
        =============
        
        Refer to this page, http://pythonhosted.org/MCres/MCres.html
        
        
        Requirements
        ============
        
        MCres requires the following Python packages:
        
        * NumPy, Scipy: for basic numerical routines
        * astropy.io.fits: for angle units
        * corner: for plotting
        * matplotlib: for plotting
        * time: for basic stuff
        
        MCres is tested on Linux and Python 2.7 only, but should cross-plateform without too many issues.
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        If you use anaconda, the easiest and fastest way to get the package up and running is to
        install MCres using `conda <http://conda.io>`_::
        
          $ conda install MCres --channel MCres
        
        You can also install MCres from PyPI using pip, given that you already
        have all the requirements::
        
          $ pip install MCres
        
        You can also download MCres source from GitHub and type::
        
          $ python setup.py install
